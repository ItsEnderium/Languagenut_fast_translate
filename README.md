This project is designed to make Languagenut assignments much faster to complete by giving you the translations when you search for them and if there is one result removing it from the list.

Guide:
1) On the task you want to speedrun, click Printables in the corner, then select Vocab List, select all and download it.
2) Open the file in your browser and select all items in the table with both the French and English translations, not including the header or other table with only one language.
3) Copy and paste the selected text into input.txt. You can delete the file now.
4) Run the code and start the Languagenut task. Do not stop the code until the task is complete or it will reset the list.
5) Search for part of the question in the project. If multiple results come up condense your search. The number before a result is its line number, inputting it will only give you that result.
6) When one result comes up it will be removed from the list. There will be one French and one English text. Whichever one isn't the question is the answer, and it's not case sensitive but everything else must be exact.
7) Repeat until the task is complete.
